CLOCK ANGLE PROBLEM
 
Given a four digit integer ranging from 0000 to 2359.
 
Write a method that will calculate the smallest angle made by the hour hand and the minute hand of an analog clock.
Assume hour hand hand rests at the given number, suppose at 0330, the hour hand will stop at 3, not in between 3 & 4, the minute hand stops at 30. 
 
Asssume there are no seconds.

For example, at 0345, the angle will be 180 degrees

Things to do!!!!

Display a error message to if user enters number greater than 2359 or a negative number.
Find precise angles between hands, assuming every hands move by the second
Add a second hand and find the angles.
